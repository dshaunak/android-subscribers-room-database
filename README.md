1. This is a simple project to implement concepts such as Kotlin Room Database, Kotlin Coroutines, RecyclerView, Repositories in MVVM, ViewModel Factory, EventWrappers, Kotlin higher order functions.
2. The goal of the project was to implement all the above mentioned concepts with the best coding practices, accounting for error handling and preventing data leaks.
3. MVVM architecure was strictly follwed for this project, hence even the UI Toast message updates are initiated via a Event class instead of directly from the ViewModel.
